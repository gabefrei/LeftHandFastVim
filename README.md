LeftHandFastVim
===============

This project is dedicated for fast operation in vim using mainly left hand instead of both hands. 

Editing in vim is fast, but it can be faster!

Suppose you are a right-handed person. If you use vim intensively, you might notice that, at times, switching from mouse to keyboard and type commands is not that efficient. 

There are several time-killers:
1) Switching back and forth between mouse and keyboard
2) Both Vim's default leader key ('/'), and the customized comma key (',') are located at right hand area of keyboard. This forces vimers to use both hands
3) The 'shift' key is not convenient to press
4) The command prefix ':'
5) The 'ESC' key is too far away!

The purpose of this project is to librate the right hand, concentrate on the left hand, and boost the editing speed in vim.
